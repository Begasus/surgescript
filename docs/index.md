Why SurgeScript?
----------------

Are you a game developer in pain? Are you a modder feeling confined?

- Unleash your creativity! â€” build your own content with ease and power!

Unlike other programming languages, SurgeScript has been designed with the specific needs of games in mind. Its features include:

- The state-machine pattern: objects are state machines (and the game loop is defined implicitly)
- The composition approach: you may design complex objects and behaviors by means of composition
- The hierarchy system: objects have a parent and may have children, in a tree-like structure

Other benefits include:

- Small footprint, easy to integrate
- C-like syntax, including plenty of features
- Automatic garbage collection
- Easy to extend via Plugins
- It's free and open source software

These features come from the experience of the developer dealing with game engines, applications related to computer graphics and so on. Some of the best practices have been incorporated into the language itself, making things really easy for developers and modders.

Who created this?
-----------------
SurgeScript was originally created by [Alexandre Martins](https://github.com/alemart), a computer scientist from Brazil. Many thanks to the Open Surge Community for the continued feedback.
