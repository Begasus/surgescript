Welcome to SurgeScript!
=======================

SurgeScript is a scripting language for games. It has unique features that make it suitable for games - and it is extremely valuable for empowering users to generate their own content. Built originally for the Open Surge Engine, SurgeScript can be embedded into any C project.

The best way to try SurgeScript for the first time is to get [Open Surge](download#open-surge). Alternatively, a standalone version of the language is also available on [GitHub](download#standalone-version).

It's such a joy to program in SurgeScript! You and your users will love it.

SurgeScript in a nutshell
-------------------------

SurgeScript is:

* A scripting language for games
* Easy for beginners, powerful for experts
* Free and open-source
* Object-oriented, dynamically typed and based on state machines
* The only programming language in the world that allows you to tag objects with emoticons (natively! ;)

You can start your learning adventure by checking the [Hello World Tutorial](tutorials/hello.md).

Why SurgeScript?
----------------

Unlike other programming languages, SurgeScript is designed for games. In SurgeScript, you have a collection of objects. Objects are units featuring data and code. Each object defines a state machine, as well as a parent-child relationship to other objects. This proves to be hugely valuable for games, specially if you are going to support user-generated content.

Creating new things and customizing game behaviors is easier than ever before, yet the language is powerful enough to bring many of the programming constructs that you find in regular object-oriented languages. An infinite amount of flexibility can be achieved through object composition.

The motivation behind SurgeScript is to allow players to unleash their creativity and build their own content with ease, flexibility and massive amounts of power.

Who did this?
-------------
SurgeScript was originally conceived by [Alexandre Martins](https://github.com/alemart), a developer from Brazil. Many thanks to the Open Surge community for the continued feedback.
