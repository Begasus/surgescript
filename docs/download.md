Download SurgeScript
====================

There are two ways to get SurgeScript:

- The first is to [get Open Surge](#open-surge). This is recommended for most users.
- The second is to [get the standalone version](#standalone-version) of the language. This is useful if you're a developer and want to integrate SurgeScript into your own projects.

Open Surge
----------

To get Open Surge, visit [opensurge2d.org](http://opensurge2d.org) and follow the instructions there.

When you get Open Surge, you also get a full game engine featuring SurgeScript. This allows you to create your own scripts and games with plenty of interactivity and ease.

Once you download Open Surge, the next step is to [create your first script](tutorials/hello).

Standalone version
------------------

To get the standalone version, go to the [SurgeScript page on GitHub](https://github.com/alemart/surgescript). There you'll find instructions on how to compile SurgeScript.

When you compile SurgeScript, you'll end up with a text-only program. There are no graphics and no game engine is attached to it. You can try your scripts using the command line.

Once you get the standalone version, the next step is to [create your first script](tutorials/hello).
