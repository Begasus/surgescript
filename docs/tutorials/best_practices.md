Best Practices
==============

- Read the [Components](components) section. It's crucial that you understand.
- Follow the golden rule: objects should **not** mess with each others' internals!
    - Objects should **not** change other objects' variables or states directly (won't allow it!)
    - Objects should define [functions](functions) that can be operated upon by the external world (API)
- Use *camelCase* names for both variables and functions.
- Use *4 spaces* for indenting your code.
- Read this documentation often.
