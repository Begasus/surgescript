  <summary>A scripting language for games</summary>
  <description>
    <p>SurgeScript is a scripting language for games. Use it to unleash your creativity and build your own amazing interactive content! It's such a joy to use SurgeScript! Its features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The state-machine pattern: objects are state machines, making it easy to create in-game entities</li>
      <li>The composition approach: you may design complex objects and behaviors by means of composition</li>
      <li>The hierarchy system: objects have a parent and may have children, in a tree-like structure</li>
      <li>The game loop: it's defined implicitly</li>
      <li>Automatic garbage collection, object tagging and more!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SurgeScript is meant to be used in games and in interactive applications. It's easy to integrate it into existing code, it's easy to extend, it features a C-like syntax, and it's free and open-source software.</p>
