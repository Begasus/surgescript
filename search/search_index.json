But what's a finite state machine?\n\n\nState machines\n\n\nA finite state machine is a mathematical abstraction composed of a finite number of \nstates\n and by \ntransitions\n between these states. Only one state can be active at any given time (we'll call it the active state). There must be one \ninitial state\n (i.e., the first one to be active). A transition is a change of the active state that is triggered when a certain condition is met.\n\n\nAs a concrete example, suppose that you want to create a door in your game. You, the developer, may open or close the door at will.\n\n\nThat is said to be an \ninformal\n description of the problem. We need to transform it in something more rigorous. What is a door? We'll show one possible solution here.\n\n\nA door is an object with two states (see the Figure below):\n\n\n\n\nOpened (initial state)\n\n\nClosed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Opened state, only one transition is possible: Close.

In some programming languages, these are known as associative arrays or hash tables. Here's the syntax:\n\n\nobject \nSurge\n\n{\n    // A dictionary that stores the weight (kg) of each character\n    weight = {\n        \nSurge\n: 35,\n        \nNeon\n: 20,\n        \nCharge\n: 37.5,\n        \nGimacian\n: 70\n    };\n\n    // print the weights\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        Console.print(\nSurge weighs \n + weight[\nSurge\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nNeon weighs \n + weight[\nNeon\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nCharge weighs \n + weight[\nCharge\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nGimacian weighs \n + weight[\nGimacian\n] + \n kg.\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries have many interesting properties and operations that you can see in the \nLanguage Reference\n.\n\n\nCautionary note\n\n\nWhenever you define an array or a dictionary, you spawn a new object. One is advised to \nNOT\n define arrays or dictionaries within states, because the code within states run continuously. Therefore, new objects will be created at every frame, not just once.\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    // arr will be instantiated once the object is created\n    arr = [ 1, 2, 3 ]; // RIGHT!\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // err is instantiated at every frame of the application,\n        // thus memory is wasted with duplicate objects\n        err = [ \ndon't\n, \ndo\n, \nthis\n ]; // WRONG!\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nScoping\n\n\nVariables that are defined before any state or function are \nobject-level\n variables.

A transition is a change of the active state that is triggered when a certain condition is met.\n\n\nAs a concrete example, suppose that you want to create a door in your game. You, the developer, may open or close the door at will.\n\n\nThat is said to be an \ninformal\n description of the problem. We need to transform it in something more rigorous. What is a door? We'll show one possible solution here.\n\n\nA door is an object with two states (see the Figure below):\n\n\n\n\nOpened (initial state)\n\n\nClosed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Opened state, only one transition is possible: Close. Once the Close transition is called, the door will go to the Closed state. Conversely, from the Closed state, only one transition is available: Open. When the Open transition is executed, the door will return to the Opened state.\n\n\nObjects in SurgeScript\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, each object has a name. Objects may have any number of states you'd like. The initial state is always called \nmain\n. The syntax is as follows:\n\n\nobject \nname of the object\n\n{\n    state \nstate name\n\n    {\n        // code goes here\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe following code shows an example of a door that opens and closes (it keep changing states) every 2 seconds:\n\n\nobject \nCosmic Door\n\n{\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // the object starts at the main state\n        state = \nopened\n; // go to the opened state\n    }\n\n    state \nopened\n\n    {\n        if(timeout(2)) // if we have been on the opened state for 2+ seconds\n            state = \nclosed\n; // go to the closed state\n    }\n\n    state \nclosed\n\n    {\n        if(timeout(2))\n            state = \nopened\n;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNotice how the code just shown defines states and transitions between these states.
