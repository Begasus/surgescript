In SurgeScript, the game loop is defined implicitly. State machines stand out as one of the key features of SurgeScript.\n\n\n\n\nState machines\n\n\nA finite state machine is a mathematical abstraction composed of a finite number of \nstates\n and by \ntransitions\n between these states. Only one state can be active at any given time (we'll call it the active state). There must be one \ninitial state\n (i.e., the first one to be active). A transition is a change of the active state that is triggered when a certain condition is met.\n\n\nAs a concrete example, suppose that you want to create a door in your game.

Variables can also point to more complex data structures (such as arrays and dictionaries), but these are always objects.\n\n\nTypes\n\n\nPrimitive types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nA floating-point number\n\n\n1, 2, 3, 3.14159\n\n\n\n\n\n\nString\n\n\nSome text\n\n\n\"Hello, world!\", 'single-quoted'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean\n\n\nTrue or false\n\n\ntrue, false\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\n\n\nReference to an object\n\n\nApplication, this, [ ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull\n\n\nAn empty value\n\n\nnull\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, the script below features an object with 3 variables that may be accessed throughout the whole object:\n\n\nobject \nSurge\n\n{\n    name = \nSurge the Rabbit\n;\n    age = 23;\n    underage = false;\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        Console.print(name); // Surge the Rabbit\n        Console.print(age); // 23\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAbstract types\n\n\nArrays\n\n\nArrays are collections of values that you may access using a zero-based index. Example:\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    // The 'characters' array hold 3 strings\n    characters = [ \nSurge\n, \nNeon\n, \nCharge\n ];\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // who are the characters?\n        Console.print(\nThe characters are:\n);\n        Console.print(characters[0]); // will print Surge\n        Console.print(characters[1]); // will print Neon\n        Console.print(characters[2]); // will print Charge\n\n        // how many characters?\n        Console.print(\nNumber of characters:\n);\n        Console.print(characters.length); // will print 3\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nArrays have many interesting properties and operations that you can see in the \nLanguage Reference\n.\n\n\nDictionaries\n\n\nDictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. In some programming languages, these are known as associative arrays or hash tables. Here's the syntax:\n\n\nobject \nSurge\n\n{\n    // A dictionary that stores the weight (kg) of each character\n    weight = {\n        \nSurge\n: 35,\n        \nNeon\n: 20,\n        \nCharge\n: 37.5,\n        \nGimacian\n: 70\n    };\n\n    // print the weights\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        Console.print(\nSurge weighs \n + weight[\nSurge\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nNeon weighs \n + weight[\nNeon\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nCharge weighs \n + weight[\nCharge\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nGimacian weighs \n + weight[\nGimacian\n] + \n kg.\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries have many interesting properties and operations that you can see in the \nLanguage Reference\n.\n\n\n\n\nCautionary note\n\n\nWhenever you define an array or a dictionary, you spawn a new object. One is advised to \nNOT\n define arrays or dictionaries within states, because the code within states run continuously. Therefore, new objects will be created at every frame, not just once.\n\n\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    // arr will be instantiated once the object is created\n    arr = [ 1, 2, 3 ]; // RIGHT!\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // err is instantiated at every frame of the application,\n        // thus memory is wasted with duplicate objects\n        err = [ \ndon't\n, \ndo\n, \nthis\n ]; // WRONG!\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCasting\n\n\nYou can use type-casting to change the type of values from number to string, from string to number, from boolean to string and so on. Casting values is as simple as calling \nNumber(value)\n, \nString(value)\n or \nBoolean(value)\n. Example:\n\n\n// Convert string to number\nstr = \n2\n;\nval = Number(str); // val is 2\n\n// Convert number to string\nval = 123;\nstr = String(val); // str is \n123\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen converting an object to a string, SurgeScript will implicitly call \nobject.toString()\n.\n\n\nScoping\n\n\nVariables that are defined before any state or function are \nobject-level\n variables. They can be accessed throughout the whole object. On the other hand, variables used exclusively inside states or functions are \nlocal variables\n. This means that their lifespan is restricted to their own locus of code.\n\n\nobject \nSurge\n\n{\n    name = \nSurge the Rabbit\n; // object-level variable\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        weight = 35; // local variable\n        state = \nprint-data\n; // change the state\n    }\n\n    state \nprint-data\n\n    {\n        Console.print(name); // Surge the Rabbit\n        Console.print(weight); // ERROR: weight is not defined\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, \nobject-level\n variables may only be accessed within the object. Other objects may not read or write the variables directly (in other words, variables are \nprivate\n to the objects). You need to define \nfunctions\n or \ngetters and setters\n to accomplish that.",

On the other hand, \nsum()\n takes two input parameters, \na\n and \nb\n, and returns the sum \na\n + \nb\n:\n\n\nobject \nCalculator\n\n{\n    fun greet()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nHello! I am a Calculator!\n);\n    }\n\n    fun sum(a, b)\n    {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn function \nsum()\n, variables \na\n and \nb\n hold the input data and are only visible inside the function.\n\n\nNow, let's create a program that uses this \nCalculator\n. Remember that the functions defined above can be called by any object, including \nApplication\n:\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    calculator = spawn(\nCalculator\n);\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // greet the user\n        calculator.greet();\n\n        // do some computation\n        result = calculator.sum(5, 7);\n        Console.print(result);\n\n        // we're done!\n        Application.exit();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the above program is:\n\n\nHello! I am a Calculator!\n12\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the \nApplication\n does not need to know \nhow\n the functions of the \nCalculator\n are implemented. It just needs to know \nwhat\n they do. This means that you may change the implementation of the \nCalculator\n without changing the \nApplication\n, and the end-result will stay the same.\n\n\nRecursive functions\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, a function is said to be \nrecursive\n when it calls itself within its code. Recursion can be useful in many ways; namely, when you define a problem in terms of itself. In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer number \nn\n, denoted as \nn!\n, is such an example:\n\n\nn! = { n * (n-1)!    if n \n 1\n     { 1             otherwise\n\n\n\n\nOne interesting example of recursion that arises in computer science is called the \nbinary search\n algorithm. Given a sorted \nArray\n, the binary search finds the position of a target value without having to inspect the whole collection. In the example below, \nbsearch()\n is a recursive function:\n\n\nobject \nBinarySearch\n\n{\n    // Given an array *sorted in ascending order*, find()\n    // finds the position of the target value in the array.\n    // It returns its index, or -1 if the target is not found.\n    fun find(array, value)\n    {\n        return bsearch(array, value, 0, array.length - 1);\n    }\n\n    // Performs a binary search in array[start..end]\n    fun bsearch(array, value, start, end)\n    {\n        // get the middle point\n        mid = start + Math.floor((end - start) / 2);\n\n        // compare the middle point to the target value\n        if(start \n end)\n            return -1; // target not found\n        else if(value == array[mid])\n            return mid; // found the target value\n        else if(value \n array[mid])\n            return bsearch(array, value, start, mid - 1);\n        else\n            return bsearch(array, value, mid + 1, end);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nRecursive functions must have at least one base case. A base case is a scenario that does not need recursion to solve the problem. In the factorial example, the base case is \nn \n= 1\n (the factorial is 1). In the binary search example, the base case is \nstart \n end\n, meaning that the array is empty and the target value cannot be found, or \nvalue == array[mid]\n, meaning that the target value has been found at \nmid\n.\n\n\nAs the sages say: \nto understand recursion, you must first understand recursion\n.\n\n\nConstructors and destructors\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, constructors and destructors are special functions that are called whenever objects are created and destroyed, respectively. It's not mandatory to define them, but it may be useful to do so (to set up things, for example). Neither may receive any arguments.\n\n\nLet's take our \nCalculator\n again. In the following example, \nconstructor()\n is called automatically whenever a \nCalculator\n object is created. Likewise, \ndestructor()\n is called automatically when the object is destroyed.\n\n\nobject \nCalculator\n\n{\n    fun constructor()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nCreating a Calculator...\n);\n    }\n\n    fun destructor()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nDestroying a Calculator...\n);\n    }\n\n    fun greet()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nHello! I am a Calculator!\n);\n    }\n\n    fun sum(a, b)\n    {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow, if we run the \nApplication\n of the previous section without any modification, the output of the program will be:\n\n\nCreating a Calculator...\nHello! I am a Calculator!\n12\nDestroying a Calculator...\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that, for any object, its \nconstructor()\n runs \nbefore\n its main state.",

            "text": "Plugins\n\n\nPlugins are objects that allow you to extend the functionalities of the language. Once declared, they can be imported anywhere in the code. They can also be easily shared with others, so everyone benefits.\n\n\nAvailable since:\n SurgeScript 0.5.2\n\n\nBasic example\n\n\nSuppose you want to extend the language by adding new routines related to string manipulation. The routines you want will be used frequently throughout your project, and you'd like easy access to them. This makes it perfect for implementing them as a plugin.\n\n\nWe'll define an object called \nStringUtils\n with a \nreverse()\n function that reverses a string. We make the object a plugin by annotating it with \n@Plugin\n. Please see in the example below:\n\n\n// File: stringutils.ss\n\n@Plugin\nobject \nStringUtils\n\n{\n    fun reverse(str)\n    {\n        buf = \n;\n        for(i = str.length - 1; i \n= 0; i--)\n            buf += str[i];\n        return buf;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen you annotate an object definition with \n@Plugin\n, SurgeScript will spawn an instance of such an object before spawning the \nApplication\n. Additionally, the plugin object may be imported anywhere with the \nusing\n keyword:\n\n\n// File: app.ss\nusing StringUtils;\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        str = StringUtils.reverse(\nalucard\n);\n        Console.print(str); // will print \ndracula\n\n        exit();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n it's recommended not to include any special characters in the name of your plugins, otherwise you may have trouble importing them.\n\n\nIn the example above, \nApplication\n and \nStringUtils\n are located in two separate files. If you want to test them using the SurgeScript command line utility, pass both files as parameters:\n\n\nsurgescript plugin.ss app.ss\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpawning order\n\n\nAlthough plugins are spawned before the \nApplication\n object, for the time being they are spawned in no particular order. You may not access a plugin from within the constructor of another plugin, as of now there is no dependency resolver implemented. Use the \nmain\n state.\n\n\n\n\nPackage example\n\n\nYou may use the Plugin system to create an independent package (or namespace) that aggregates many functionalities. This lets you separate your code in coherent, logical units and also helps you to distribute it.\n\n\nSuppose that user \nParrot\n, the owner of \nParrotSoft\n, created SurgeScript utilities related to string manipulation, matrix math and complex numbers. He decided to share his code as a single package called \nParrotSoft\n. Since he implemented getters for each of his utilities (see the code below), his package provides easy access to all of them. Furthermore, he annotated his package with \n@Plugin\n (but \nnot\n the individual utilities), so his package can be accessed anywhere.\n\n\n// File: parrotsoft.ss\n\n@Plugin\nobject \nParrotSoft\n\n{\n    matrices = spawn(\nParrotMatrices\n);\n    complex = spawn(\nParrotComplexNumbers\n);\n    stringUtils = spawn(\nParrotStringUtils\n);\n\n    fun get_Matrices()\n    {\n        return matrices;\n    }\n\n    fun get_Complex()\n    {\n        return complex;\n    }\n\n    fun get_StringUtils()\n    {\n        return stringUtils;\n    }\n}\n\n// ...\n\n\n\n\nA user of the \nParrotSoft\n package may import \nParrot\n's utilities simply by importing the plugin. Individual utilities may also be imported. The code below shows a usage example:\n\n\nusing ParrotSoft.Matrices.Matrix2;\nusing ParrotSoft.Complex;\nusing ParrotSoft;\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        identity = Matrix2([[1, 0], [0, 1]]); // 2x2 matrix\n        z = Complex(2, 3); // 2 + 3i\n        neon = ParrotSoft.StringUtils.reverse(\nnoen\n);\n        exit();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, writing \nComplex\n is equivalent to writing \nParrotSoft.Complex\n, since we imported this utility with \nusing ParrotSoft.Complex\n. Notice that \nParrotSoft\n implements a getter for \nComplex\n. Additionally, \nParrotSoft\n has been annotated with \n@Plugin\n, but \nComplex\n has \nnot\n.

The routines you want will be used frequently throughout your project, and you'd like easy access to them. This makes it perfect for implementing them as a plugin.

This lets you separate your code in coherent, logical units and also helps you to distribute it.  Suppose that user  Parrot , the owner of  ParrotSoft , created SurgeScript utilities related to string manipulation, matrix math and complex numbers. He decided to share his code as a single package called  ParrotSoft . Since he implemented getters for each of his utilities (see the code below), his package provides easy access to all of them. Furthermore, he annotated his package with  @Plugin  (but  not  the individual utilities), so his package can be accessed anywhere.  // File: parrotsoft.ss\n\n@Plugin\nobject  ParrotSoft \n{\n    matrices = spawn( ParrotMatrices );\n    complex = spawn( ParrotComplexNumbers );\n    stringUtils = spawn( ParrotStringUtils );\n\n    fun get_Matrices()\n    {\n        return matrices;\n    }\n\n    fun get_Complex()\n    {\n        return complex;\n    }\n\n    fun get_StringUtils()\n    {\n        return stringUtils;\n    }\n}\n\n// ...

Notice that  ParrotSoft  implements a getter for  Complex . Additionally,  ParrotSoft  has been annotated with  @Plugin , but  Complex  has  not .

            "text": "Advanced features\n\n\nThis section describes advanced features of SurgeScript.\n\n\nLookup operator\n\n\nSome programming languages, such as C++, have a feature called \noperator overloading\n. It's a \nsyntactic sugar\n that allows the programmer to attribute custom implementations to different operators.\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, the \n[ ]\n operator (also called the \nlookup operator\n), used by Arrays and Dictionaries, is used to \nget\n and \nset\n values from/to the data structure. In fact, the \n[ ]\n operator can be used by any object, for any purpose. It is necessary to define, in your object, functions \nget()\n and \nset()\n with the following signature:\n\n\nfun get(key)\n{\n    // custom implementation\n}\n\nfun set(key, value)\n{\n    // custom implementation\n}\n\n\n\n\nGiven an object \nobj\n, the expression \nx = obj[key]\n is equivalent to \nx = obj.get(key)\n. Similarly, \nobj[key] = value\n is equivalent to \nobj.set(key, value)\n.\n\n\nFunctors\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, objects can be made to behave like functions. We call these objects \nfunctors\n (or function objects). To make an object behave like a function, you have to overload the \n( )\n operator (also known as the \nfunction operator\n). This is done by defining function \ncall()\n in your object:\n\n\nfun call()\n{\n    // custom implementation\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction \ncall()\n may take any number of parameters. Given an object \nf\n, the expression \ny = f(x)\n is equivalent to \ny = f.call(x)\n. Notice that, since \nf\n is an object, you may exchange its implementation during runtime.\n\n\nFactory\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, a factory is a functor that spawns an object for you. The object can be spawned and configured in a single call. In the example below, factory \nGreeter\n spawns and configures \nGreeting\n objects. We annotate the factory with \n@Plugin\n, so it can be imported anywhere in the code.\n\n\nTo the end-user, calling \nGreeter()\n is simpler than manually spawning and configuring a \nGreeting\n every time it is needed.\n\n\n// Factory example\nusing Greeter; // import the factory\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // This will print:\n        // Hello, alex!\n        g = Greeter(\nalex\n);\n        g.greet();\n        exit();\n    }\n}\n\n// File: greeting.ss\nobject \nGreeting\n\n{\n    public name = \nanon\n;\n\n    fun greet()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nHello, \n + name + \n!\n);\n    }\n}\n\n@Plugin\nobject \nGreeter\n\n{\n    // Greeter is a factory. It spawns and configures\n    // a Greeting object for you. Being a plugin,\n    // Greeter can be used anywhere in the code.\n    fun call(name)\n    {\n        g = spawn(\nGreeting\n);\n        g.name = name;\n        return g;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nPlease note: in the example above, objects spawned by the factory will be children of the factory. If you need the parent of the spawned object to be the caller object, then you might simply write \ng = caller.spawn(\"Greeter\")\n. Keyword \ncaller\n points to the object that called the function (or \nnull\n if not applicable).\n\n\nIterators\n\n\nAs seen in the \nloops\n section, the foreach loop may be used to iterate through a collection. In SurgeScript, a collection is an object (but the opposite is not always true). You may implement your own collections by implementing function \niterator()\n. If you have ever used Java, you'll find this to be familiar.\n\n\nobject \nMyCollection\n\n{\n    fun iterator()\n    {\n        // function iterator() takes no arguments and \n        // should return a new iterator object\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor each collection you define, you should also define its iterator object. The iterator object should implement functions \nnext()\n and \nhasNext()\n (both take no arguments):\n\n\nobject \nMyIterator\n\n{\n    fun next()\n    {\n        // returns the next element of the collection\n        // and advances the iteration pointer\n        // the collection is usually the parent object\n    }\n\n    function hasNext()\n    {\n        // returns true if the enumeration isn't over\n        // returns false if there are no more elements\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou may iterate through a collection using the following code:\n\n\nit = collection.iterator();\nwhile(it.hasNext()) {\n    x = it.next();\n\n    // do something with x\n    // x is an element of the collection\n    Console.print(x);\n}\n\n\n\n\nOr, alternatively, using the compact foreach:\n\n\nforeach(x in collection) {\n    Console.print(x);\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor the sake of completion, the following code demonstrates how to implement a custom collection that hold even numbers from 0 up to 20.\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    evenNumbers = spawn(\nEvenNumbers\n);\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // iterate through the collection\n        foreach(number in evenNumbers)\n            Console.print(number);\n\n        // exit the app\n        Application.exit();\n    }\n}\n\nobject \nEvenNumbers\n\n{\n    fun iterator()\n    {\n        return spawn(\nEvenIterator\n);\n    }\n}\n\nobject \nEvenIterator\n\n{\n    nextNumber = 0;\n\n    fun next()\n    {\n        currentNumber = nextNumber;\n        nextNumber += 2;\n        return currentNumber;\n    }\n\n    fun hasNext()\n    {\n        return nextNumber \n= 20;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe result of this code is:\n\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20",

The basic usage of an Iterator is as follows:  // container is an object such as an Array\niterator = container.iterator(); // spawn an iterator to traverse the container\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()) {\n    element = iterator.next();\n    Console.print(element);\n}",
