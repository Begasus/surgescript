In SurgeScript, you have a collection of objects. Objects are units featuring data and code. Each object defines a state machine, as well as a parent-child relationship to other objects. This proves to be hugely valuable for games, specially if you are going to support user-generated content.\n\n\nCreating new things and customizing game behaviors is easier than ever before, yet the language is powerful enough to bring many of the programming constructs that you find in regular object-oriented languages. An infinite amount of flexibility can be achieved through object composition.\n\n\nThe motivation behind SurgeScript is to allow players to unleash their creativity and build their own content with ease, flexibility and massive amounts of power.\n\n\nWho did this?\n\n\nSurgeScript was originally conceived by Alexandre Martins, a developer from Brazil.
