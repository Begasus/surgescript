Each object define a finite state machine, a mathematical construct used to describe the behavior of in-game objects. But what's a finite state machine?\n\n\nState machines\n\n\nA finite state machine is a mathematical abstraction composed of a finite number of \nstates\n and by \ntransitions\n between these states. Only one state can be active at any given time (we'll call it the active state). There must be one \ninitial state\n (i.e., the first one to be active). A transition is a change of the active state that is triggered when a certain condition is met.\n\n\nAs a concrete example, suppose that you want to create a door in your game. You, the developer, may open or close the door at will.\n\n\nThat is said to be an \ninformal\n description of the problem. We need to transform it in something more rigorous. What is a door? We'll show one possible solution here.\n\n\nA door is an object with two states (see the Figure below):\n\n\n\n\nOpened (initial state)\n\n\nClosed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Opened state, only one transition is possible: Close. Once the Close transition is called, the door will go to the Closed state. Conversely, from the Closed state, only one transition is available: Open. When the Open transition is executed, the door will return to the Opened state.\n\n\nObjects in SurgeScript\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, each object has a name. Objects may have any number of states you'd like. The initial state is always called \nmain\n.

Example:\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    // The 'characters' array hold 3 strings\n    characters = [ \nSurge\n, \nNeon\n, \nCharge\n ];\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // who are the characters?\n        Console.print(\nThe characters are:\n);\n        Console.print(characters[0]); // will print Surge\n        Console.print(characters[1]); // will print Neon\n        Console.print(characters[2]); // will print Charge\n\n        // how many characters?\n        Console.print(\nNumber of characters:\n);\n        Console.print(characters.length); // will print 3\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nArrays have many interesting properties and operations that you can see in the \nLanguage Reference\n.\n\n\nDictionaries\n\n\nDictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. In some programming languages, these are known as associative arrays or hash tables. Here's the syntax:\n\n\nobject \nSurge\n\n{\n    // A dictionary that stores the weight (kg) of each character\n    weight = {\n        \nSurge\n: 35,\n        \nNeon\n: 20,\n        \nCharge\n: 37.5,\n        \nGimacian\n: 70\n    };\n\n    // print the weights\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        Console.print(\nSurge weighs \n + weight[\nSurge\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nNeon weighs \n + weight[\nNeon\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nCharge weighs \n + weight[\nCharge\n] + \n kg.\n);\n        Console.print(\nGimacian weighs \n + weight[\nGimacian\n] + \n kg.\n);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDictionaries have many interesting properties and operations that you can see in the \nLanguage Reference\n.\n\n\n\n\nCautionary note\n\n\nWhenever you define an array or a dictionary, you spawn a new object. One is advised to \nNOT\n define arrays or dictionaries within states, because the code within states run continuously. Therefore, new objects will be created at every frame, not just once.\n\n\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    // arr will be instantiated once the object is created\n    arr = [ 1, 2, 3 ]; // RIGHT!\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // err is instantiated at every frame of the application,\n        // thus memory is wasted with duplicate objects\n        err = [ \ndon't\n, \ndo\n, \nthis\n ]; // WRONG!\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCasting\n\n\nYou can use type-casting to change the type of values from number to string, from string to number, from boolean to string and so on. Casting values is as simple as calling \nNumber(value)\n, \nString(value)\n or \nBoolean(value)\n. Example:\n\n\n// Convert string to number\nstr = \n2\n;\nval = Number(str); // val is 2\n\n// Convert number to string\nval = 123;\nstr = String(val); // str is \n123\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen converting an object to a string, SurgeScript will implicitly call \nobject.toString()\n.\n\n\nScoping\n\n\nVariables that are defined before any state or function are \nobject-level\n variables. They can be accessed throughout the whole object. On the other hand, variables used exclusively inside states or functions are \nlocal variables\n. This means that their lifespan is restricted to their own locus of code.\n\n\nobject \nSurge\n\n{\n    name = \nSurge the Rabbit\n; // object-level variable\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        weight = 35; // local variable\n        state = \nprint-data\n; // change the state\n    }\n\n    state \nprint-data\n\n    {\n        Console.print(name); // Surge the Rabbit\n        Console.print(weight); // ERROR: weight is not defined\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, \nobject-level\n variables may only be accessed within the object. Other objects may not read or write the variables directly (in other words, variables are \nprivate\n to the objects). You need to define \nfunctions\n or \ngetters and setters\n to accomplish that.",

On the other hand, \nsum()\n takes two input parameters, \na\n and \nb\n, and returns the sum \na\n + \nb\n:\n\n\nobject \nCalculator\n\n{\n    fun greet()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nHello! I am a Calculator!\n);\n    }\n\n    fun sum(a, b)\n    {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn function \nsum()\n, variables \na\n and \nb\n hold the input data and are only visible inside the function.\n\n\nNow, let's create a program that uses this \nCalculator\n. Remember that the functions defined above can be called by any object, including \nApplication\n:\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    calculator = spawn(\nCalculator\n);\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // greet the user\n        calculator.greet();\n\n        // do some computation\n        result = calculator.sum(5, 7);\n        Console.print(result);\n\n        // we're done!\n        Application.exit();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe output of the above program is:\n\n\nHello! I am a Calculator!\n12\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the \nApplication\n does not need to know \nhow\n the functions of the \nCalculator\n are implemented. It just needs to know \nwhat\n they do. This means that you may change the implementation of the \nCalculator\n without changing the \nApplication\n, and the end-result will stay the same.\n\n\nRecursive functions\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, a function is said to be \nrecursive\n when it calls itself within its code. Recursion can be useful in many ways; namely, when you define a problem in terms of itself. In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer number \nn\n, denoted as \nn!\n, is such an example:\n\n\nn! = { n * (n-1)!    if n \n 1\n     { 1             otherwise\n\n\n\n\nOne interesting example of recursion that arises in computer science is called the \nbinary search\n algorithm. Given a sorted \nArray\n, the binary search finds the position of a target value without having to inspect the whole collection. In the example below, \nbsearch()\n is a recursive function:\n\n\nobject \nBinarySearch\n\n{\n    // Given an array *sorted in ascending order*, find()\n    // finds the position of the target value in the array.\n    // It returns its index, or -1 if the target is not found.\n    fun find(array, value)\n    {\n        return bsearch(array, value, 0, array.length - 1);\n    }\n\n    // Performs a binary search in array[start..end]\n    fun bsearch(array, value, start, end)\n    {\n        // get the middle point\n        mid = start + Math.floor((end - start) / 2);\n\n        // compare the middle point to the target value\n        if(start \n end)\n            return -1; // target not found\n        else if(value == array[mid])\n            return mid; // found the target value\n        else if(value \n array[mid])\n            return bsearch(array, value, start, mid - 1);\n        else\n            return bsearch(array, value, mid + 1, end);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nRecursive functions must have at least one base case. A base case is a scenario that does not need recursion to solve the problem. In the factorial example, the base case is \nn \n= 1\n (the factorial is 1). In the binary search example, the base case is \nstart \n end\n, meaning that the array is empty and the target value cannot be found, or \nvalue == array[mid]\n, meaning that the target value has been found at \nmid\n.\n\n\nAs the sages say: \nto understand recursion, you must first understand recursion\n.\n\n\nConstructors and destructors\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, constructors and destructors are special functions that are called whenever objects are created and destroyed, respectively. It's not mandatory to define them, but it may be useful to do so (to set up things, for example). Neither may receive any arguments.\n\n\nLet's take our \nCalculator\n again. In the following example, \nconstructor()\n is called automatically whenever a \nCalculator\n object is created. Likewise, \ndestructor()\n is called automatically when the object is destroyed.\n\n\nobject \nCalculator\n\n{\n    fun constructor()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nCreating a Calculator...\n);\n    }\n\n    fun destructor()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nDestroying a Calculator...\n);\n    }\n\n    fun greet()\n    {\n        Console.print(\nHello! I am a Calculator!\n);\n    }\n\n    fun sum(a, b)\n    {\n        return a + b;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow, if we run the \nApplication\n of the previous section without any modification, the output of the program will be:\n\n\nCreating a Calculator...\nHello! I am a Calculator!\n12\nDestroying a Calculator...\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that, for any object, its \nconstructor()\n runs \nbefore\n its main state.",

            "text": "Advanced Features\n\n\nThis section describes advanced features of SurgeScript.\n\n\nLookup operator\n\n\nSome programming languages, such as C++, have a feature called \noperator overloading\n. It's a \nsyntactic sugar\n that allows the programmer to attribute custom implementations to different operators.\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, the \n[ ]\n operator (also called the \nlookup operator\n), used by Arrays and Dictionaries, is used to \nget\n and \nset\n values from/to the data structure. In fact, the \n[ ]\n operator can be used by any object, for any purpose. It is necessary to define, in your object, functions \nget()\n and \nset()\n with the following signature:\n\n\nfun get(key)\n{\n    // custom implementation\n}\n\nfun set(key, value)\n{\n    // custom implementation\n}\n\n\n\n\nGiven an object \nobj\n, the expression \nx = obj[key]\n is equivalent to \nx = obj.get(key)\n. Similarly, \nobj[key] = value\n is equivalent to \nobj.set(key, value)\n.\n\n\nFunctors\n\n\nIn SurgeScript, objects can be made to behave like functions. We call these objects \nfunctors\n. To make an object behave like a function, you have to overload the \n( )\n operator (also known as the \nfunction operator\n). This is done by defining function \ncall()\n in your object:\n\n\nfun call()\n{\n    // custom implementation\n}\n\n\n\n\nFunction \ncall()\n may take any number of parameters. Given an object \nf\n, the expression \ny = f(x)\n is equivalent to \ny = f.call(x)\n. Notice that, since \nf\n is an object, you may exchange its implementation during runtime.\n\n\nIterators\n\n\nAs seen in the \nloops\n section, the foreach loop may be used to iterate through a collection. In SurgeScript, a collection is an object (but the opposite is not always true). You may implement your own collections by implementing function \niterator()\n. If you have ever used Java, you'll find this to be familiar.\n\n\nobject \nMyCollection\n\n{\n    fun iterator()\n    {\n        // function iterator() takes no arguments and \n        // should return a new iterator object\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor each collection you define, you should also define its iterator object. The iterator object should implement functions \nnext()\n and \nhasNext()\n (both take no arguments):\n\n\nobject \nMyIterator\n\n{\n    fun next()\n    {\n        // returns the next element of the collection\n        // and advances the iteration pointer\n        // the collection is usually the parent object\n    }\n\n    function hasNext()\n    {\n        // returns true if the enumeration isn't over\n        // returns false if there are no more elements\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou may iterate through a collection using the following code:\n\n\nit = collection.iterator();\nwhile(it.hasNext()) {\n    x = it.next();\n\n    // do something with x\n    // x is an element of the collection\n    Console.print(x);\n}\n\n\n\n\nOr, alternatively, using the compact foreach:\n\n\nforeach(x in collection) {\n    Console.print(x);\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor the sake of completion, the following code demonstrates how to implement a custom collection that hold even numbers from 0 up to 20.\n\n\nobject \nApplication\n\n{\n    evenNumbers = spawn(\nEvenNumbers\n);\n\n    state \nmain\n\n    {\n        // iterate through the collection\n        foreach(number in evenNumbers)\n            Console.print(number);\n\n        // exit the app\n        Application.exit();\n    }\n}\n\nobject \nEvenNumbers\n\n{\n    fun iterator()\n    {\n        return spawn(\nEvenIterator\n);\n    }\n}\n\nobject \nEvenIterator\n\n{\n    nextNumber = 0;\n\n    fun next()\n    {\n        currentNumber = nextNumber;\n        nextNumber += 2;\n        return currentNumber;\n    }\n\n    fun hasNext()\n    {\n        return nextNumber \n= 20;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe result of this code is:\n\n\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20",

The iterator object should implement functions  next()  and  hasNext()  (both take no arguments):  object  MyIterator \n{\n    fun next()\n    {\n        // returns the next element of the collection\n        // and advances the iteration pointer\n        // the collection is usually the parent object\n    }\n\n    function hasNext()\n    {\n        // returns true if the enumeration isn't over\n        // returns false if there are no more elements\n    }\n}  You may iterate through a collection using the following code:  it = collection.iterator();\nwhile(it.hasNext()) {\n    x = it.next();\n\n    // do something with x\n    // x is an element of the collection\n    Console.print(x);\n}  Or, alternatively, using the compact foreach:  foreach(x in collection) {\n    Console.print(x);\n}  For the sake of completion, the following code demonstrates how to implement a custom collection that hold even numbers from 0 up to 20.  object  Application \n{\n    evenNumbers = spawn( EvenNumbers );\n\n    state  main \n    {\n        // iterate through the collection\n        foreach(number in evenNumbers)\n            Console.print(number);\n\n        // exit the app\n        Application.exit();\n    }\n}\n\nobject  EvenNumbers \n{\n    fun iterator()\n    {\n        return spawn( EvenIterator );\n    }\n}\n\nobject  EvenIterator \n{\n    nextNumber = 0;\n\n    fun next()\n    {\n        currentNumber = nextNumber;\n        nextNumber += 2;\n        return currentNumber;\n    }\n\n    fun hasNext()\n    {\n        return nextNumber  = 20;\n    }\n}  The result of this code is:  0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20",

The basic usage of an Iterator is as follows:  // container is an object such as an Array\niterator = container.iterator(); // spawn an iterator to traverse the container\nwhile(iterator.hasNext()) {\n    element = iterator.next();\n    Console.print(element);\n}",
